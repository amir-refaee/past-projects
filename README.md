# README

Welcome to my repository. Here you will find samples of code I've written for projects in the past that are permissible to be displayed to the public. 

### PAT.py
GPU Kernels for 3D Delay-and-Sum photoacoustic tomography in addition to the implementation of the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA - [Beck 2009](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/FISTA)).

### train-GAN.py
Training routine for the pix2pix model [Isola 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf) for denoising photoacoustic radio frequency data.
